## 🌟 Features

- **Cross-Platform Native Styling & Window Behaviors**:
  - **macOS**: Beautiful frosted glass translucent window styling.
  - **Windows**: Deep integration with Windows 11/10. Uses highly compatible solid-color elegant light grey backgrounds to completely avoid "completely transparent/hollow window" rendering bugs on low-end or customized OS graphics configurations.
  - **System Tray & Window Controls**: Provides a polished system tray menu to toggle visibility via single left-click. Supports setting autostart, silent launching (tray-only backend start), and minimizing to tray instead of quitting on close.
- **Automatic Agent Discovery**: Automatically scans and lists all installed AI coding assistants and their global/project-level Skills directories.
- **Smart & Safe Sync Engine**:
  - Supports both **Global** and **Project** workspace scopes.
  - **Safety Backups**: If a physical folder conflicts with a symlink target during activation or deactivation, it automatically performs a timestamped backup (`[Folder].bak_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`) instead of throwing errors or destroying code.
  - **Windows Symlinks & Case Correction**: Deep support for Windows symlink configurations and two-step renaming hacks to avoid case-sensitivity issues and self-deletion bugs on Windows file systems.
- **High-Performance Git Caching & Updates**:
  - **Worker Queue Limiter**: Limits concurrent network requests to 3 to prevent CPU and connection spikes, keeping UI interactions (like switching tabs) smooth.
  - **Repo SHA-256 Hashing**: Repositories are persistently mapped and cached by Git URLs inside `app_data_dir/cache/repos/`.
  - **10-Second Deduplication Lock + Incremental Fetching**: Repetitive check requests within 10 seconds reuse cache. Beyond 10 seconds, it uses shallow `git fetch --depth 1` + hard reset, slashing check times from minutes down to **seconds**.
- **Skill Leaderboards & Document Translation**:
  - **Multi-Dimensional Rankings**: Supports toggling between "Leaderboard" and "Grid Card" views. Under the leaderboard view, online skills are ranked by All Time, Trending (24h), and Hot categories, showing 8-week activity trends sparklines and download statistics.
  - **Inline Translation**: Built-in document translator in the detail panel to translate English skill READMEs to Chinese with one click, supporting seamless reversion to English.
- **Precise Update Statuses**:
  - Inline tracking of remote repository versions (`checking` / `available` / `current` / `check-failed`).
  - **Detailed Error Cards**: If a Git check fails, detailed Rust/Git error logs are presented directly inline on a soft red warning card.
- **Troubleshooting & Fixes**: Detects orphaned directories, broken symlinks, mismatched frontmatter names, and missing metadata with one-click naming alignments.

## 🚀 Installation

### macOS

1. Download the latest `Manage My skills_*.dmg` from GitHub Releases.
2. Double-click and drag the application to your `Applications` folder.
3. On first launch, you might need to approve it under **System Settings → Privacy & Security**.

### Windows

1. Download the `.exe` installer or portable executable and run it.
2. _Note: Using Symlink syncing on Windows requires running the application as Administrator OR turning on "Developer Mode" in your Windows Settings._

---

## 🏗️ Build & Development

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥ 18
- **Rust** (installed via rustup)

### Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/manage-my-skills.git
cd manage-my-skills
npm install

# Start development build with frontend HMR and Rust hot reload
npm run tauri:dev
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Frontend only
npm run dev

# Run Rust unit tests
npm run test:rust

# Full smoke test (build validation + runs all test suites)
npm run smoke
```

### Compiling Production Binaries

To build installers for your current platform:

```bash
npm run tauri:build
```

Build files will be generated under `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

#### One-Click Version Bumping & Compiling (Automation Script)

We provide an automated, error-tolerant publishing script that synchronizes the version string across `package.json`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, and `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, then triggers compilation:

```bash
# Example: Bump to 0.2.3 and build
npm run release -- 0.2.3
```

**💡 Encryption & Signing Keys Setup:**

- **To generate signed updater artifacts**: Create a `.env` file at the project root (automatically ignored by `.gitignore`), then configure your signing credentials:
  ```env
  TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY="YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_CONTENT"
  TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD="YOUR_PASSWORD"
  ```
- **Local Unsigned Build Mode**: If no private key is detected, the script will temporarily disable `createUpdaterArtifacts` in a clone profile and compiled unsigned executables successfully without crashing. It then restores your configuration back automatically.

---

## 📡 CI/CD Pipeline

The project features integration with GitHub Actions via `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

- Runs TypeScript type checks, Vite production build, and Rust tests automatically on every PR or push to the `main` branch.
- Automates release compiles for Windows/macOS upon pushing tags, uploading release bundles straight to GitHub Releases.

---

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS + Lucide Icons + Radix UI
- **Desktop Runtime**: Tauri v2 (Rust)
- **Core Systems**: Rust (`walkdir`, `serde` serialization, `tokio` multi-threaded async pooling)
- **Design Language**: Quiet, high-density, native tool experience
